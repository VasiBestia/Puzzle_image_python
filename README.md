Overview 🌟

This project demonstrates how I solved a puzzle made of two images 🖼️🖼️ with different sizes and transparencies. The goal was to overlay them perfectly using Python! 🐍✨

How I Did It 🛠️

Loaded the images using Python libraries (like PIL/Pillow) 📥

Handled different sizes by resizing or adjusting positions 🖌️

Managed transparency by setting alpha channels properly 💡

Overlayed the images to create a combined result 🔄

Displayed and saved the final image with transparency applied 🖼️💾

Features ✨

Handles images of different dimensions 📏

Supports semi-transparent overlays 🌫️

Uses Pythonic approach for clean and efficient code 🐍

Result 🎉
Two images combined beautifully
Puzzle solved without losing transparency or details ✅
